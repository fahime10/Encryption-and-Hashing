# Encryption-and-Hashing
## What the app does
This app was designed to use Doctrine for running queries into the database. The app provides a form that the user needs to complete to register themselves into the 
database. The details required are username, password, and dietary requirements. When the password is provided, the built-in function password_hash hashes the password, so
the database has the hashed version of the password.
This app can be used to design simple login forms as it is possible to safely store passwords into the database.
